# Generative Hand Pose Synthesis

This repository documents the development of a diffusion model to generate synthetic hand-pose images. This project serves as a practical application of generative AI to solve the common problem of data scarcity in computer vision tasks.

## Project Goal

The primary objective is to build and train a deep learning model capable of generating high-fidelity, realistic images of hands in various poses. This synthetically generated data can then be used to augment training sets for other models, such as gesture classifiers.

## Motivation

This project is directly inspired by the challenges faced in specialized AI domains, such as medical imaging, where collecting large, diverse datasets is often difficult. By mastering these generative techniques, we can create more robust and accurate computer vision systems.

## Technical Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Framework:** PyTorch
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV
